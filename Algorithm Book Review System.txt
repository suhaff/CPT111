Algorithm: Book Review System

1. BEGIN

2. INITIALIZE Data Structures:
   a. Declare a map `books` to store book information (key: `bookID`, value: `Book` struct).
   b. Declare a vector `reviews` to store review data (`Review` structs).

3. LOAD BOOK DATA:
   a. Open the file `books.txt`.
   b. WHILE there are lines to read in the file:
      i. Extract `bookID` and `title` from the current line.
      ii. Add (`bookID`, `Book(bookID, title)`) to the `books` map.
   c. CLOSE the file.

4. LOAD REVIEW DATA:
   a. Open the file `reviews.txt`.
   b. WHILE there are lines to read in the file:
      i. Extract `bookID`, `username`, `rating`, and `comment` from the current line.
      ii. Add `Review(bookID, username, rating, comment)` to the `reviews` vector.
   c. CLOSE the file.

5. DISPLAY MENU OPTIONS:
   a. DO:
      i. PRINT:
         - "1. Display reviews by book ID"
         - "2. Add a new review"
         - "3. Exit"
      ii. PROMPT user for a choice.

6. HANDLE USER INPUT:
   a. IF the user selects "1. Display reviews by book ID":
      i. PROMPT for a `bookID`.
      ii. SEARCH the `reviews` vector for reviews matching `bookID`.
         - IF reviews are found:
            - PRINT the `username`, `rating`, and `comment` for each matching review.
         - ELSE:
            - PRINT "No reviews found for this book."
   b. IF the user selects "2. Add a new review":
      i. PROMPT for `bookID`, `username`, `rating` (1-5), and `comment`.
      ii. VALIDATE the `bookID`:
         - IF `bookID` exists in `books` map:
            - CREATE a new `Review` object with the given data.
            - ADD the new review to the `reviews` vector.
            - OPEN `reviews.txt` in append mode.
            - WRITE the new review to the file in the format: `bookID username rating comment`.
            - PRINT "Review added successfully."
         - ELSE:
            - PRINT "Invalid book ID."
   c. IF the user selects "3. Exit":
      i. PRINT "Exiting program. Changes saved."
      ii. EXIT the loop.

7. END.
